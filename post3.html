            <h3>The Importance of Knowing How to Code</h3>
            <p>Hello STEAM Train Users! I'm Mira Nair and today I'm going to talk(write) to you about the importance of
                learning how to code or knowing about technology. When I say learning to code, I mean to learning JavaScript,
                 HTML/CSS/JS, Python, C++ and much more. When I say learning about Technology, I meaning learning about, Machine
                  Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and much more! Honestly, I don't know 1/4 of the list I just gave
                  you but you probably don't know but I don't know it... yet. 

                            <br><br>

                            These days every career that there is requires some laptop, iPhone, iPad or ANY form of technology.
                            For The STEAM Train, I had to learn how to code in HTML/CSS to create this website. I also had 
                            to use Google Slides to create the content. Even for a small garage sale you need it. My friend Emily,
                            had a garage sale had SO many people who wanted to buy her stuff. But, there was a catch. These people 
                            didn't have any cash with them and only had credit cards, paypal accounts, apple pay, google pay and 
                            much more but she didn't have any technology devices and just some loose cash change so she couldn't 
                            make those purchases. At the end of a 3 hour day, she only made 5 dollars and that was a tip from her Mom. 
                            The point is that, you CANNOT survive in the REAL world without technology. Of course you could in the old
                            days but now we are so much more techy so without our technology we would be nowhere! Make sure you know the
                             technology around you and how to use it!
