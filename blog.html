                <h3>Welcome to the STEAM Train!</h3>
                <p>Hello STEAM Train Users! My name is Mira Nair and as of March 2022, I am 10 years old. I started the STEAM Train 
                    originally as a class project for 4th grade. I go to a IB school in Texas and we had to do something called
                     "Exhibition", which shows what we learnt all year combined into a passion. My passions are coding, writing and
                      teaching others so I decided to make the STEAM Train.....</p>

                <h3>The Importance of Coding</h3>
                <p>Hello STEAM Train Users! I'm Mira Nair and today I'm going to talk(write) to you about the importance of
                     learning how to code or knowing about technology. When I say learning to code, I mean to learning JavaScript,
                      HTML/CSS/JS, Python, C++ and much more. When I say learning about Technology, I meaning learning about, Machine

                <h3>The Importance of Entrepreneurship</h3>
                <p>Hello STEAM Train Users! Today, I'm talking about the importance of Entreupreneurship. These days, our generation
                    is becoming very independent and we don't want to work for other people's companies... We want to make those
                    companies. With Entrepreneurship(and a little Coding) you can make your very first start-up like the STEAM Train
                    with the help of our courses......
