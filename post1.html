            <h3>Welcome to the STEAM Train</h3>
            <p>Hello STEAM Train Users! My name is Mira Nair and as of March 2022, I am 10 years old. I started
                  the STEAM Train originally
                   as a class project for 4th grade.
                    I go to a IB school in Texas
                     and we had to do something
                      called "Exhibition", which
                       shows what we learnt all
                        year combined into a passion.
                         My passions are coding,
                          writing and teaching others
                           so I decided to make the
                            STEAM Train.

                            <br><br>
                                Firstly, I had the idea. I planned out how this site would look at all the courses. Then I started working.
                            I had a lot of obstacles... Especially this blog page you are reading in right now. I had know idea what to write
                            and if I would be showing off and I really didn't want to be coding a blog page each post I made. But... I couldn't 
                            find another way so I ended up coding a whole page for each post I made.

                            <br><br>
                            
                                I also had a lot of trouble with the courses. I knew that other people had A LOT more experience than a 10 year old like me 
                            so, I shared my email(miralananair@gmail.com), on this site so if people had other courses that they wanted to share they could just 
                            give it to me. They could also share blog posts to my email(minimum: 3 sentences)I couldn't have made the STEAM Train without
                            the help of those people. I also want to say thanks to the teachers and my mentors for proofreading my courses and all the other
                            courses. Without them, I would totally be entering 100% false information into my site. Literally.. 

                            <br><br>

                                    I also want to say thanks to my STEM teacher, Ms. Passi for making a fun STEM class ALWAYS! Whether it
                                was marble runs, Binary Code, ASCII, Typing, Laws of Physics, Acing the Traditional Egg Drop Contest, Learning Python
                                and much more! Thanks SO much! She helped me learn a lot of stuff and gave me an example of how to teach kids "boring"
                                stuff nicely so that they'll LOVE it! 

                                <br><br>

                                I finally want to say thanks to a book. Actually, to be more clear, it's author and helpers.
                                 Laura Cowan, Nikolaos Papadopoulos, Anna Wray, Vickie Robinson, Jenny Offley and Samuel Gorham.
                                 Thanks a lot (Especially the first 2). Without the book, I wouldn't be able to code in HTML/CSS/JS. I finally
                                 want to thank the most, the YouTube channel Tech2 etc. It additionally helped me coding in HTML/CSS.

                                 <br><br>

                                 And I want to say a special thanks to all of you guys reading this right now because all of my efforts
                                 would be wasted if you guys didn't read and come to my website, so thank you!
