            <h3>The Importance of Entrepreneurship</h3>
            <p>Hello STEAM Train Users! Today, I'm talking about the importance of Entreupreneurship. These days, our generation
                is becoming very independent and we don't want to work for other people's companies... We want to make those
                companies. With Entrepreneurship(and a little Coding) you can make your very first start-up like the STEAM Train
                with the help of our courses. 

                            <br><br>

                            So, how do you start a business? Great question! If you are a kid and you asked this question 
                            your parents probably said, "You need, Grit, self control, curiosity, Money-management, Marketing Skills,
                            and much more just to create a small business. And you have none of that.". Is that what you're parents said? 
                            That's at least what mine said. After that I tried to learn them all during Covid-19, taking advantage
                            of the situation. That's how I created, "The STEAM Train". 
                            <br><br>
                            Not only did I need all of the qualities
                             listed above, I also needed to know how to code. This is where most people spend their most money 
                             on if they don't know how to code. Thank god I know how to code, but in business, if you don't know how to code, it'll be 
                             really hard for you to start a business. If you don't know how to code, you end up paying 100's of
                             dollars trying to find some developer to make them a website that ends up being VERY crappy. But 
                             these days you don't want other people being your boss! YOU WANT TO BE THE BOSS! That's why entrepreneurship
                             is so important and everyone has to learn the attributes above.
